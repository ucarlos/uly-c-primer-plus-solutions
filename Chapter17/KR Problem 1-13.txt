Array solution:
    Requires two arrays in a  structure
    | n1 | n2 | n3 | n4 | -- array1 -- Holds length
    | e1 | e2 | e3 | e4 | -- array2 -- Holds occurrences of each value in array1

procedure:
    for each string in char *[] argc
        find the string length of a string
        Search array 1 if it exists
          if found, increment array 2 value
          if not found, add length to array and increment array 2 value
          if not found and adding length to array is greater than array length, then expand array
    end for loop

    sort structure using only array1

    print histogram
        for every value in structure
               print array1, and draw x for its array2 value(another for loop)
               newline
        end for loop
end procedure


It would be better to hold the strings in a balanced binary search tree which would speed up searching,
